                <p class="xs-mb3">Hello World! I'm Shubham Agnihotri, a Computer Science Graduate from 
                    <a href="https://www.msruas.ac.in/">Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences</a>. Solving Puzzles, Riddles and Mathematical problems are few of my interests. 
                    I wish to decipher the world for the people by solving 
                    their day-to-day problems with the use of advancing technologies. I believe that contributions have a significant impact on society. 
                    Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing are my tools to shape a better future. Gone are the days when people used to work like machines,
                    AI powered with QC will help humans be humane. 
                </p>
                <p class="xs-mb3">
                    I am employed at <a href="https://www.arcadis.com/en/global/">Arcadis</a> as a Graduate Consultant in Advance Analytics, where I develop AI/ML models for
                     internal company projects and clients. In addition to this, I write scripts to automate workflows. I also work at <a href="https://sites.google.com/theschoolofai.in/theschoolofai/home">The School of AI</a> as an AI Researcher and Intern.
                     Here I am researching in the domain of Vision and working over different SOTA networks to solve problems. 
                     I have previously worked at  <a href="https://www.bemrr.com/">Bemrr - Division of Episodic Labs</a> as Machine Learning and Computer Vision Intern. I had developed and deployed 
                     object detection and classification models over Android and wrote scripts to transform real time streaming images. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="xs-mb3">
                    When I am not multiplying matrices or swimming in the pool of 1s and 0s, I am either playing Football/Badminton or exploring new places. 
                    I try to spare time to read research papers, books and novels. Action-Adventure games like Assassin Creed, Tomb Raider, The Witcher, etc. are my favorite passtimes. 
                    Their storyline and graphics really fascinate me. Somehow I  fit my ethusiasm for motivating people in this schedule.
                </p>
                
                <p class="xs-mb3">I want to contribute in the field of AI and QC. Hence, I'm looking for a full time Research opportunity in it. If you want to chat, feel free to reach out.
